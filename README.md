* Problem Statement - 1: Matching the misspelt cities.

There are two data files (.csv)
1. Correct_cities.csv : This file consists of a list of cities and they are spelt correctly. It has three columns "name" which is a city name; "country" where the city belongs to and "id" which is a unique id for each city.

2. Misspelt_cities.csv : This file consists of city names which are mispelt. Each city name has been misspelt by randomly replacing 20% of the characters by some random characters. It has two columns "misspelt_name" and "country".

Question : Write an algorithm or a group of algorithms to match the misspelt city name with the correct city name and return the list of unique ids for each misspelt city name.

For example : Correct Data -> (Bangalore, India, 101) and say for "Bangalore" the misspelt name is (Banhakorg, India). Then the matching algorithm should return 101 for this example.

**Solution: Here we have used Levenshtein distance to find the most simmilar word from each missplelt word.**

* Problem Statement - 2: Find the Semantic Similarity

Part - 1:
Given a list of sentences (list_of_setences.txt) write an algorithm which computes the semantic similarity and return the similar sentences together.

Semantic similarity is a metric defined over a set of documents or terms, where the idea of distance between them is based on the likeness of their meaning or semantic content.

For example : "Football is played in Brazil" and "Cricket is played in India". Both these sentences are about sports so they will have a semantic similarity.

Part - 2:
Extend the above algorithm in form of a REST API. The input parameter is a list of sentences (refer to the file list_of_setences.txt) and the response is a list of list with the similar sentences. 

For example : Say there are 4 sentences as an input list - 
["Football is played in Brazil" ,
"Cricket is played in India",
"Traveling is good for health",
"People love traveling in winter"]

Output : [["Football is played in Brazil" , "Cricket is played in India"], ["Traveling is good for health", "People love traveling in winter"]]

**Solution:  Here we are using word-embeddings from pretrained word2vec models. Since the dataset is very small, other NLP encoding** **technique  like: bag of words, TF-IDF or creating a word2vec model from this dataset, will not yeild good results.** 
**We have to download the [GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit) for referencing the word-embeddings.**
